# PlotlyDeploy
This project will use JavaScript and Plotly to visualize data on bacteria in humans belly buttons to help determine the bacteria to be used for a company which sells non-meat beef products

## Purpose off the project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to visualize data of bacteria found in people’s belly buttons. My client, Roza, has teamed up with a company, Improbable beef, to find bacteria in people’s belly buttons. The proteins of this bacteria will be synthesized to taste like beef. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to find the data on the mostly commonly found bacteria, Roza conducted a study to gather bacteria from people. She assigned each person an ID number and matched their bacteria to them. From this data, if a bacteria is found to be synthesized to taste like beef, Roza can contact the people to gather further bacteria from them. The data is visualized in a bar chart to show the top ten bacteria found in people, a gauge chart to visualize how many times a week people scrubbed their belly button, and a bubble chart displaying all of the bacteria contained but which was more prevalent. All three charts can be filtered by each person’s ID number choosing a different ID number in the drop-down menu.
